# üçÖ Pomodoro

### What is Pomodoro?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

### Description
The original technique has six steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (25 minutes) - Click Start Button
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (5 minutes)
5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros (a check mark will appear at the bottom of the program after each work session).
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (20 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

You can reset the timer by clicking the reset button.
